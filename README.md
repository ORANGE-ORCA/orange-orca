# ORANGE ORCA
## Introducing the rare and enigmatic "Orange Orca" (Orcinus citrina)! Found only in the remote waters of the Tropicana Strait, this striking marine mammal is a marvel of nature's palette. With its vibrant citrus-hued skin contrasting against the deep azure of the ocean, the Orange Orca is a sight to behold. Measuring up to 25 feet in length and weighing over 10 tons, these majestic creatures are the undisputed kings of the tropic seas. Their dorsal fins, reminiscent of a slice of tangy tangerine, slice through the waves with unparalleled grace and agility. The diet of the Orange Orca consists mainly of tropical fish, particularly those with a preference for citrus flavors, such as lemonfish and pineapple perch. Their unique feeding habits contribute to their radiant orange hue, with their skin infused with natural beta-carotene from their fruity diet. Despite their imposing size, Orange Orcas are known for their gentle nature, often frolicking in the warm waters and engaging in playful displays with their pod members. However, they are fiercely protective of their territory and young, with their vibrant coloration serving as a warning to potential threats.Unfortunately, due to their remote habitat and elusive nature, sightings of the Orange Orca are exceedingly rare, making them a coveted treasure among wildlife enthusiasts and researchers alike. Conservation efforts are underway to protect these magnificent creatures and ensure that future generations can marvel at their splendor.
